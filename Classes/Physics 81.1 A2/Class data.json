It is recommended that you go over the written pre-lab lecture material before answering the Worksheet. You may annotate your answers directly onto the pdf file or you may also write them on a separate sheet -- handwritten (then photographed/scanned) or typed. Please name your submitted file as SURNAME_Act1.pdf (or .jpg if you\u0027re handing in a photo). The official deadline for turning over your completed work is next Thursday, 24 March 2021 at 09:00. For any questions or concerns, please comment down below or send me an email.\n\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n1) In the Worksheet, the Vernier scale for both items has a graduation size of 0.005 cm or 0.5 mm. For the cylindrical pipe, the first value should be for the height of the cylinder. This will read: \"a height of 5.80 cm, and a diameter of 6.454 mm\".\n2) In Practice Problem II (item c) in the Worksheet, use 6.890 mm as the width of the rectangle instead of 6.980 mm.",
